Package: rpostgis
Title: A Package for Import/Export of Spatial Data from PostGIS
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Josh", "London", email = "josh.london@noaa.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Rpostgis provides simple access to PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial databases
  without the need to build the `rgdal` packages from source (pre-built binaries
  on CRAN are not built against the PostgreSQL/PostGIS libraries). Initially,
  the focus of this package is on reading and writing data, but further 
  development for various spatial functions could be considered.
Depends: R (>= 3.2.0)
