#' Rpostgis: A package for import/export of spatial data from PostGIS
#'
#' Rpostgis provides simple access to PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial databases
#' without the need to build the rgdal packages from source (pre-built binaries
#' on CRAN are not built against the PostgreSQL/PostGIS libraries). Initially,
#' the focus of this package is on reading and writing data, but further 
#' development for various spatial functions could be considered.
